                    <p>This was my first time working on a UX project with a team, and I really enjoyed the experience.</p>
                    <p>This project showed difficulties that can arise when integrating 3rd party services as wonky integration were the cause of two major navigation issues (the e-commerce site as well as the careers listings). With some UX and careful thinking about the structure and user flow, the difficulties could be smoothed out with UX.</p>
                    <p>If I had a chance to work more on this project, I would have wanted to conduct a second round of usability testing&mdash;this time on the redesign, to see if the numbers improved.</p>
