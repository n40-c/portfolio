                <p>
                    Dutch Bros is a drive-through chain known for coffee, customizable drinks and friendly staff. It has 500+ locations across the United States, mainly along the west & southwest regions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>With 25%&ndash;75% of users failing simple “find” tasks</em>
                    such as a store location’s address, the core purpose of the Dutch Bros website was undermined.                </p>

                <p>
                    Users are able to navigate smoothly due to improvements such as: clarifications and streamlining of the site structure; and making backtracking easy

    <section>
        <h4>Survey</h4>
        
        <section>
            <h5>Methods</h5>
            <p>We collaborated to create and conduct a 13-question survey to gather insights into user demographics and primary goals when visiting the Dutch Bros website. The 38 respondents had varying levels of familiarity with the brand, including some loyal customers. This offered a well-rounded view of user needs and expectations.
            </p>

            <div class="finding-box">
                <h6>Key user goals: Menu, locations, and store hours
                </h6>
                <p>Repondants revealed that the primary reason they visit the Dutch Bros website is to view the menu, find a store location, or check store hours. Thus, it is critical that users are able to access this information quickly.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="finding-box">
                <h6>Comfort with technology varied
                </h6>
                <p>Respondents’ self-reports of tech proficiency ran the gamut from low to advanced, highlighting the importance of features that are easy to identify and use for all users–regardless of digital proficiency.

        <h4>Personas</h4>
        
        <p>To encourage empathy and user-centered designs, we created two personas based on survey data. Here are snapshots of the personas.
        </p>
        <p>These personas guided design solutions to address the needs of speed-focused and enjoyment-focused users.

        <h4>Web Accessibility Guidelines
        </h4>

        <section>
            <h5>Methods</h5>
            <p>To discover potential usability issues, I conducted a systematic evaluation using Dr. David Travis’ Web Accessibility Guidelines, which evaluates designs for general accessibility and usability issues for all users (in comparison, WCAG is a legal and technical standard, not a design standard. In addition, it focuses on accessibility for people with disabilities rather than general usability). 
            </p>
            <p>Scores were calculated based on the design’s success rates across the 20-40 checklist items for each accessibility category.

                </h6>
                <p>With 100% being a perfect score, middling scores on the homepage (63%) and navigation (66%) indicated barriers to finding key information, which would reduce user success and satisfaction. This was later validated by usability testing.

        <h4>Usability Testing
        </h4>

        <section>
            <h5>Methods</h5>
            <p>To validate evaluation findings and assess the core tasks that bring value to users and Dutch Bros, we created and conducted usability testing using targeted scenarios and tasks.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-0"><em>Goals:</em>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Accessing the menu and store info</em>
                </li>
                <li><em>Workforce recruitment</em> 
                </li>
                <li><em>Online shopping</em>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>We decided to focus on these areas as they were critical goals. In particular, the first area was highlighted by users as their purpose for using the website, while the latter two are important tasks for the company to maintain their workforce and secondary income stream.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h5>Analysis</h5>
            <p>We held a group synthesis session to analyze the data and identify key usability concerns. I took the initiative to create a Google spreadsheet that would automatically calculate metrics and highlight critical results, while other team members took charge of qualitative analysis. 
            </p>

                <h6>Navigation confusion blocked key tasks
                </h6>
                <p>A confusing site structure and unclear labeling prevented users from completing key tasks.

                <ul>
                    <li><em>Online shop:</em> 38% of participants failed to navigate between the main site and e-commerce store, often not realizing they were on a separate site (as Dutch Bros uses a 3rd party platform for e-commerce).
                    </li>
                    <li><em>Recruitment:</em> 25% couldn’t find HQ job opening due to a misleading “View Openings” button that only showed barista openings.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>One participant said they would “give up in a real situation,” highlighting the real-world impact of navigation failure.

                <ul>
                    <li><em>Menu & store info:</em> Shortcuts on the home page made the menu and store info accessible in seconds, but participants instead averaged 1.5 minutes for each task by overlooking the unlabeled shortcut buttons.

        <h4>Stakeholder Communication
        </h4>
        <p>To communicate progress, insights, and to get stakeholder buy-in, we created 2 pieces of stakeholder communication:

        <ul class="list-unstyled">
            <li class="mb-2"><i class="bi bi-easel2-fill text-primary me-1"></i><em class="text-primary">Presentation:</em> Reported key usability issues and design recommendations to ensure informed stakeholder decisions and team alignment.

    <h3>Takeaways</h3>

    <section>
        <h5>Collaboration multiplies impact
        </h5>
        <p>I really enjoyed the experience working with my first time UX team. Peer critique with multiple points of view helped us form ideas faster and stay user-centered without bias. This was a very encouraging experience for seeking feedback and leveraging the power of collaborative design.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h5>Progress through incremental change
        </h5>
        <p>This project expanded my view of design to include small, incremental wins that build up major impact. UX improvements don’t have to be (and usually aren’t) complete overhauls.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h5>If we had more time: Validate solutions
        </h5>
        <p>Given more time, I would have liked to validate the design solutions with a second round of usability testing, especially as we can simply compare the “before” and “after” metrics such as time taken or success rates to evaluate effectiveness.
