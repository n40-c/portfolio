                    <p>This project highlighted to me the importance of testing with real users. The obstacles and opportunities I discovered during research and analysis were very different from what I had personally expected. Testing ensured that I was addressing real issues.</p>
                    <p>If I had more time, I would like to create a prototype and conduct another round of usability testing. I would also have liked to design with a higher level of integrated animations in mind, as I only had transition animations in mind while designing.</p>
