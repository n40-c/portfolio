                    <div><p>This project centers around the app Libby, which is a portal to the digital catalog of partnered libraries, with users able to borrow and puruse library-owned content on the app.</p><p>In this project, I'll be looking at one of the main library features: book borrowing. In particular, the experience of searching for a title to borrow.</p><p>In a physical library, it's pretty standard to use the library's signage system or the Dewey decimal classification system. But how about in a virtual system? <strong>Are users able to navigate through the catalog in Libby and successfully find titles they'd like to borrow?</strong></p></div>

                <div class="descript">
                    <p>Who are the users and what do they want? In order to get a picture of users' expectations and desires, I asked 5 participants questions that ranged from general (such as asking about their motivations for borrowing) to specific (such as asking about what types of information they use to decide whether to borrow a title).</p>
                    <p>After learning expectations and desires, I evaluated the current design for points of confusion. I choose to perform a round of usability testing as it would directly show what users have trouble with. I also did a heuristics analysis using established guidelines for web design (I used the <a href="https://www.userfocus.co.uk/resources/guidelines.html">Web Accessibility Guidelines</a>) and science-backed heuristics like <a href="https://lawsofux.com/hicks-law/">Hick’s Law</a>.</p>

                    <p>This project highlighted to me the importance of testing with real users. The obstacles and opportunities I discovered during research and analysis were very different from what I had personally expected. Testing ensured that I was addressing real issues.</p>
                    <p>If I had more time, I would like to create a prototype and conduct another round of usability testing. I also would also have liked to explore more facets of the app such as the dashboard, managing holds/borrows, and so on.</p>
