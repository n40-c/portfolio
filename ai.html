            <p>
                We conducted <em>think-aloud usability testing</em> with 12 participants, particularly focused on the product’s flagship features. We used <em>affinity diagramming</em> for qualitative analysis and <em>spreadsheets</em> for quantitative analysis

This helped me group related features and find each feature’s appropriate spot in the experience path.

            <h5>Top Ideas</h5>
            <p>After reducing clutter on the interface, I ideated on how users would access the now-hidden details.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Idea 1: Flow-based.</em> Strengthens user focus since features are only available at relevant moments in the user flow.
                </li>
                <li><em>Idea 2: Static menu.</em> Gives users a clear starting point, shows what’s available, and enables access anytime via a persistent navigation element.
                </li>
                <li><em>Idea 3: Portal.</em> Emphasizes the range and number of features available; a “library”-like model.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h5>Finding Direction: Idea 1 + Idea 2
            </h5>
            <p class="mb-0">Although all three ideas fulfil the design goal, we had to consider:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Does it align with the company’s vision for the product? 
                </li>
                <li>Is it easy to learn, enabling users to engage immediately?
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            We held a group review session where the project manager and peer designers critiqued the designs based on user needs and company goals. 
            </p>
            <p><em>Thus, we decided on a mix of Idea 1 (Flow-based) and Idea 2 (Static menu).</em> We would have a persistent menu to: anchor the user experience, emphasize key features, and drive engagement; while allowing secondary features to only bubble up at key interaction points to minimize cognitive load. 
            </p>
        </section>
        </div>
    </section>
    <section class="col-md-10 col-lg-8 col-xxl-7 mx-auto">
        <h4>Drilling down: Prototypes
        </h4>
        <p>My teammates helped update designs to the new structure and layout. Throughout, we collaborated to ensure our designs were in sync–avoiding conflicting interactions, and applying shared design patterns and standards.
        </p>
        <p>In addition, to ensure alignment with product vision, we had consistent check-ins with the PM and implemented feedback.</p>

        <section>
            <h5>Mid-fidelity & high-fidelity prototypes
            </h5>
            <p>To refine the layout and interactions, I created and iterated on mid-fidelity prototypes, then refined it into high-fidelity. Throughout the process, I implemented my team’s insightful and user-centered feedback.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li class="mb-3"><em>Defining layout & interactions of the static menu:</em> I iterated on layout, visual aesthetics, and interaction flow. In particular, a challenge was fulfilling the user need of multitasking without overcomplicating the interaction. We eventually landed on a standardized, static sidebar layout with a simple 1-click customization flow. The final design balanced visibility with simplicity, reducing cognitive load while still providing easy access to the features.
                </li>
                <li><em>Separating out features to be flow-based:</em> I also worked on designing and adapting certain features for flow-based access. Based on where and when users encounter a feature (such as through the menu vs during a key interaction), the design would adjust to context and intent. For instance, a prominent overlay offering in-depth control versus a 1-click access with a subtle success message in fullscreen.

        <p>To validate the designs, we turned to AI-powered testing due to security risks of leaks from using human testers.

            <h5>Results</h5>
            <p class="mb-0">The final design was a success:

            <ul class="list-unstyled">

            <ul>
                <li>Usability testing
                </li>
                <li>A/B testing</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Both validated the new design, with resounding improvements in all metrics.

        <section>
            <h5>Validating the validator
            </h5>
            <p>Since the validation was done with AI, we had to check if the results were trustworthy. Before running the validation on the new designs, I first ran synthetic testing on the original design. 
            </p>
            <p>Comparing the AI’s results with the human testing data, we found that the AI results were trustworthy as it highlighted the same issues that plagued our human testers. 
            </p>
            <p>Thus, we were able to validate AI validation and have confidence in the success of the new design.

    <section>
        <h4>Developer Hand-off
        </h4>
        <p>With the design approved with stakeholder buy-in, we handed it off to the development team with design documentation, answered questions on the designs, and supported our design decisions. I also checked-in with the product owner (PO) to review user stories, see the implementation results, and suggest quality assurance revisions.

    <h3>Takeaways</h3>

    <section>
        <h5>Synthetic testing and validation
        </h5>
        <p>AI-driven synthetic testing helped us save time and resources without compromising quality. While it doesn’t completely replace human testing, it lets us test and validate our designs quickly, cheaply, and safely. We still needed to design thoughtful tasks, guide the focus of each test, and compile results into a clear, actionable format, but by automating the more time-consuming parts, (like recruiting, conducting sessions, and analysis) we could reserve human testing for critical moments, making the most of limited resources.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h5>Simplicity & feedback 
        </h5>
        <p>This project helped me realize that I tend to overthink and create complex solutions. Although complexity is sometimes necessary, simplicity tends to maximize usability. In this project, collaborating with others with frequent critique sessions pushed me towards simple solutions that balance clarity with impact. It was beneficial that I tended to brainstorm multiple options, as this meant exploration and comparison of both simplicity and complexity, enabling the best option to be selected. Thus, my takeaway is to push myself for simplicity and to keep brainstorming multiple ideations.
